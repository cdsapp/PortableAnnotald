# PortableAnnotald
This is a portable version of annotald (https://github.com/Annotald/annotald) for installing on new machines. The original annotald is degraded and the owners haven't updated it.
As a workaround, you can download these files and install them  into the python libraries (instructions on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQxyqNqcxhU ).
